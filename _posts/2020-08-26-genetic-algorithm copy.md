description: The code will take the provided puzzle in a 2D array form and begin to brute force a solution by recursively checking every possible move that can be made. It will stop when it finds a solution with a score of 1 (the best possible score) and print out all the moves made to get to that solution. I realize this is not necessarily the best way to go about a problem like this, but it was a fun experiment for me to play around with and a good introductory look at multiprocessing in python.
