## My Site
This is the Github repo that houses my personal website available at [bennettwendorf.dev](https://www.bennettwendorf.dev/).

## Purpose
This site acts as a quick landing page for anyone interested in what I do as well as a place for me to showcase some of the projects I have worked on.

## How to Use this Project
While this project was never intended to be used as a template, it is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is relatively easy to modify to fit your needs. Posts for each project in the portfolio are just markdown documents in the `_posts` directory. Also, many of the other settings for the site are configured in the `_config.yml` document.
